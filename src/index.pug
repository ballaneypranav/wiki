                            Sugarcane is one of the most widely-grown commercial crops in India: cultivated on almost 
                            **5 million hectares** of land in 2017. The sugar industry is the second largest in the country: 
                            contributing to around **6%** of the agricultural GDP; this puts sugarcane among the most economically 
                            important crops in the country.
                        p.
                        :markdown-it(html)
                            The sucrose present in the stem of the sugarcane exists in a dynamic equilibrium between its synthesis 
                            and utilisation. Following the harvest of the crop, this equilibrium is disturbed. Invertase – an enzyme 
                            present in the cells –  breaks down sucrose into its components: fructose and glucose, resulting in a 
                            reduction in the amount of sucrose in the stem. Ultimately the sugar recovery rate sees a reduction by 
                            anywhere between **2%** to **10%**.
                        p.
                            Our project involves targeting this enzyme. We propose to introduce genetically-modified bacteria, suspended 
                            in our novel polymer-based inoculant, into the sugarcane matrix post-harvest. The bacteria would exhibit 
                            anti-invertase activity regulated by the amount of fructose and glucose inside the sugarcane in a continuous 
                            and controlled manner.

                            Headline too cringey? Questionable color choice? Apparently orange is the color of 
                            communication. It's a really hard color to work with, though. Increasing saturation any
                            more hurts my eyes, reducing it saturation makes orange lose its effect and reducing 
                            brightness makes it dull. Btw, scroll up for an inverted Indian flag.
